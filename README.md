# THE MAZE: DARK PHANTOM

**THE MAZE: DARK PHANTOM** is a first-person, audio-based maze exploration game where players must navigate a dark, mysterious labyrinth using only spatial sound cues. With minimal lighting and a head-mounted spotlight, players rely on ambient sounds to guide them toward the finish point while avoiding dead ends and obstacles.

## Features:
- **Audio-driven gameplay**: Navigate the maze using spatial audio cues like footsteps, whispers, and a finish beacon.
- **Immersive environment**: Low lighting, fog, and detailed terrain with grass and bushes enhance the eerie atmosphere.
- **Timer**: Track the time taken to reach the exit and challenge your speed.
- **Unique mechanics**: Rely on occlusion and environmental sound to progress.

## Gameplay:
- Move through the maze with the **WASD** keys and crouch with **C**.
- **Jump** with **Space** and use your head-mounted spotlight to light the way.
- The finish point is marked by a **beacon** that grows louder as you get closer.
- The game challenges your spatial awareness and hearing as you rely on audio cues to navigate the maze.
